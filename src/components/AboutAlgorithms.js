                <h2>Logistic Regression</h2>
                <p>Logistic regression is a statistical model used to predict the probability of a binary or categorical outcome based on one or more independent variables. It is a type of regression analysis commonly used in machine learning and statistics. Logistic regression is commonly used for binary classification problems, where the outcome variable has two categories (e.g., yes/no, true/false). logistic regression is often used to understand the relationship between the independent variables and the probability of the outcome.</p>
                <h2>K-Nearest Neighbor</h2>
                <p>K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric algorithm, meaning it does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. In KNN, the training data consists of labeled examples with known classes or target values. The algorithm uses these labeled data points to make predictions for new, unseen data points. The basic idea behind KNN is to find the K nearest neighbors to a given data point in the feature space and determine the majority class or average value of those neighbors to assign a prediction.</p>
                <h2>Support Vector Machine</h2>
                <p>Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a powerful and versatile algorithm that can handle linear and non-linear relationships in the data. The primary goal of SVM is to find a hyperplane that best separates the classes or predicts the values in the case of regression. The hyperplane is chosen to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points of each class. These closest data points are known as support vectors, hence the name "Support Vector Machine."</p>
                <h2>Na√Øve Bayes Classifier</h2>
                <p>Naive Bayes classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of feature independence. It is commonly used for text classification and spam filtering, but it can also be applied to various other classification tasks. The algorithm is called "naive" because it assumes that all features in the data are independent of each other, which is often an oversimplification but can still yield good results in practice. Despite this assumption, Naive Bayes classifiers have proven to be effective and efficient in many real- world applications. Naive Bayes classifiers are widely used for text classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems. While they may not always be the most accurate algorithm, their simplicity and speed make them a popular classification tasks.</p>
                <h2>Random Forest Classifier</h2>
                <p>Random Forest Classifier is a Supervised Learning Algorithm which is popular and is used for classification and regression problems. Random Forest Algorithm has higher accuracy and problem solving ability. It is a classifier that contains several decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes average to improve predictive accuracy. It is based on concept of ensemble learning which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and improve the performance of the model.</p>
                <h2>Decision Tree Classifier</h2>
                <p>A Decision Tree Classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm that builds a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. It is widely used for both classification and regression tasks and can handle both categorical and numerical data. The basic idea behind a decision tree is to recursively partition the data based on the feature values to create a tree structure. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on a specific feature, and each leaf node represents a class label or a predicted value. Decision Tree Classifiers are widely used in various domains, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and more. They provide a straightforward and interpretable approach to machine learning, and their simplicity and efficiency make them popular for both practitioners and researchers.</p>
